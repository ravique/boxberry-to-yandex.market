# Library and script for Boxberry -> Yandex.Market API sync

# Disclaimer

This software is still in development. 

**Works with**

[Boxberry New API](https://boxberry.ru/business_solutions/it_solutions/1089980/), [Yandex.Market Partner API](https://tech.yandex.com/market/partner/doc/dg/concepts/about-docpage/) 

# Functionality

- Gets detailed data about Boxberry points of selected regions and cities
- Pushes these points to the Yandex.Market (token is needed)
- Removes points from Yandex.Market if point does not exist in Boxberry response
- Writes all actions to the log (info level by default)

# Boxberry client API

- Get city ids of region
- Get points ids of city
- Get detailed data of a point

# Yandex.Market client API

- Get list of account existing points (outlets)
- Create new point (outlet)
- Delete point

# Delivery cost override

If you want to assign custom delivery cost for selected city OR region, add it to `delivery_cost_override` table. Fill only `city_name` or `region_name` field. Name must be equivalent to Boxberry `CityName` or `Area` field.  
**The name of the region in priority!**

# How it works

- Get list of available boxberry points in city/cities and region/regions, defined as 'region_names' and 'city_names' in config.ini. Note, that city and region names should be equivalent to Boxberry. 
- If launched with --update-regions param, updates or creates table in local db, that stores info about regions.
- Deletes all points, that yet exist in Yandex.Market, but not exist in Boxberry response.
- If launched with --force-update param, updates all points in Yandex.Market, that were found in Boxberry response
- Adds new found points to Yandex.Market
- Watch log for details
